You can shape your degree to suit your interests; you could discover units like Complex Networks and Probability alongside your core modules, or choose optional vocational units like Financial Risk Management or Maths in Schools to prepare you for a particular career.\n\nThe curriculum currently includes opportunities to learn the statistical computing environment R, the Bayesian approach to estimation and prediction, and how to design powerful tests for statistical hypotheses.\n\nThe first year provides a broad background in pure, applied and statistical mathematics via a range of compulsory units. You'll cover material in lectures and small-group tutorials, with the freedom to explore a range of topics in collaboration with your personal tutor and fellow students.\n\nFrom year two you will focus more on statistics and probability, although there is still scope to take some units from other areas.\n\nAs you move through the course you will gain academic independence, moving from small-group tutorial teaching in year one to an optional, independent project in your final year.\n\nThis degree is accredited by the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) and you'll be automatically entitled to Graduate Statistician status on application to the RSS, provided you achieve at least a second class honours degree.",

    "description": "Learn computational and statistical skills that are in high demand from top employers or gain a strong basis for further study - this four-year course provides a rigorous foundation in mathematics.\n\nOur lecturers are passionate about their subject, with modules informed by cutting-edge research. You can shape your degree to suit your interests; you could discover units like Complex Networks and Probability alongside your core modules, or choose optional vocational units like Financial Risk Management or Maths in Schools to prepare you for a particular career.\n\nThe curriculum currently includes opportunities to learn the statistical computing environment R, the Bayesian approach to estimation and prediction, and how to design powerful tests for statistical hypotheses.\n\nThe first year provides a broad background in pure, applied and statistical mathematics via a range of compulsory units. You'll cover material in lectures and small-group tutorials, with the freedom to explore a range of topics in collaboration with your personal tutor and fellow students.\n\nFrom year two you will focus more on statistics and probability, although there is still scope to take some units from other areas.\n\nAs you move through the course you will gain academic independence, moving from small group tutorial teaching in year one to an independent statistics project in your final year.\n\nThis degree is accredited by the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) and you'll be automatically entitled to Graduate Statistician status on application to the RSS, provided you achieve at least a second class honours degree.",
